C3PO wants a super aggressive spam classification machine that may classify some ham messages as spam; therefore, he wants to maximize the classification of messages into spam, which means he would be on the top-right of the graph, where true positive and false positive rates are highest (all spam messages would be classified into spam [true positive] and a few non-spam messages may be wrongly classified into non-spam [false positive].) On the other hand, R2D2 is scared of missing ham emails that were classified wrongly into spam; seeing as it's less tolerant of wrong classifications (of False Positive results that return true on a spam classification test when it's in fact ham) and is willing to read some spam messages for this purpose, R2D2 will lie on the bottom left of the graph.
